Description: Pre Processor Pretty Printer for OCaml
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language,
 based on the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete
 class-based object system and a powerful module system in the
 style of Standard ML.
 .
 CamlP4 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for Objective Caml. It
 offers tools for syntax (Stream Parsers and Grammars) and the
 ability to modify the concrete syntax of the language
 (Quotations, Syntax Extensions).
 .
 This package contains the basic CamlP4 executables and libraries
 for pre-processing and pretty-printing OCaml sources both
 interactively and in a batch fashion.
